# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Goal: 
To be able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities and plan a trip accordingly
To create a weather dashboard with form inputs
When searching for a city, the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
When the user views current weather conditions for that city the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
The UV index is color coded by severity of condition.
When the user views future weather conditions for that city, the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
When the user clicks on a city in the search history, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
When the user opens the weather dashboard, the user is presented with the last searched city forecast.

## I learned:

1) How to create multiple ajax calls to a third party API
2) How to work more confidently with local storage.
3) To be slightly more comfortable with JQuery and appending items to the page.
4) How to clear search data from the page in between searches so that it won't stack.
5) How to get weather icons to pop up on the page.

## I struggled with:

1) Working with arrays in local storage.
2) Figuring out why one out of 3 ajax calls wasn't working properly (I was trying to access a paid portion of the API when there was a free version buried a little deeper in the documentation.).
3) Using for loops to append multiple items at once.
